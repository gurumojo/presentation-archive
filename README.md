presentation-archive
====================

A published collection of slides and papers relevant to work in the Graduate
School of Counseling Psychology at Naropa University


resources
---------

This solution takes advantage of [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
application deployment hosting, and an HTML presentation framework called
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).  Look into them if you've ever wondered about
free container apps or alternatives to other presentation slide solutions!


prerequisites
-------------

You'll need to have `node` and `heroku` installed and running locally.


usage
-----

Setting the environment variable `PORT` allows for configurable access to a
local demo:
```
PORT=5000 npm run demo
heroku local
...
# http://localhost:5000/
```

To start the service:
```
npm start
```
