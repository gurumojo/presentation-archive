Divergent Presentation: Terminology
					</div>
					<p class="apa fragment">
Diversity is not something any single person may posses or imbue.  Each person may be accurately labeled <strong>neurodivergent</strong> or <strong>neurotypical</strong>, while we are all collectively a <strong>neurodiverse group</strong> of people.  Neurodiversity represents a plurality, the ever unfolding set of variety in epigenetic and behavioral expression.  Therefore, such a thing as a neurodiverse person does not exist. (Walker, 2021, pp. 42-46)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
While <strong>neurodiversity</strong> concepts were originally developed on <strong>autistic</strong> listserv discussions, neurodivergent does not equate to autistic.  The <strong>neurodivergent</strong> umbrella covers everything that would be said to lie outside of conformance with more typical bodyminds, including <strong>epigenetic influences</strong> such as ADHD, cerebral palsy, or synestesia, as well as <strong>life experiences</strong> resulting in brain injuries or PTSD.

"Able-bodied identity escapes being an identity, because able-bodiedness is default and classic....  Allistic, generally speaking, means nonautistic; in like kind <strong>allism</strong> refers to the state of nonautism.  Allism’s derivation mimics that of <strong>autism</strong>, where the Greek <em>autos</em> is meant to signal self, and the Greek <em>allos</em> is meant to signal other." (Yergeau, 2018, pp. 152,168-171)

“Disability is injustice, not tragedy; unequal treatment, not inherent inequality.” (Bascom et al, 2012, p. 76)
						<br/><br/>
Cal Montgomery (quoted above) suggests that disability equates to dis-enablement as opposed to in-ability.  We must maintain a separation in our consideration of <strong>impairment (</strong><em>the ways our bodyminds differ from each other</em><strong>)</strong> and <strong>disability (</strong><em>the ways impaired people are excluded by society</em><strong>)</strong>.

Divergent Presentation: History
					</div>
					<p class="apa fragment">
The violence of selective breeding and scientific racism has been enacted via varied policies through the years, including marriage prohibitions, forced sterilization, and filicide targeting mental and physical disability, low IQ, deviant behavior, and minority membership.  In total, these were acts of <strong>political and clinical aggression</strong> inseparable from <strong>white privilege and ableism</strong> which left open questions about the risks inherent to inbreeding depression. (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)

<em>Racial Hygiene in the United States</em> is the translated title of a 1913 textbook used as “the seminal guide to <strong>applied eugenics</strong>” for German students of the time, as well as being a fully representative statement of how we arrived here.  In the 1930s, <strong>American law</strong> became the de facto eugenic blueprint for the Nazi defense of Nordic <em>Blut und Rasse</em> (e.g. Aryan blood and race) from dysgenic influences.  More than 400,000 people were <strong>forcibly sterilized</strong> by the Nazi regime. (Silberman, 2015, p. 118)

					<p class="apa fragment">
<strong>Hans Asperger</strong> maintained a focus on so-called little professors in his definition of <em>Autistic Psychopathy in Childhood</em>, noting their capacity for highly creative insight and expression.  Written contemporaneously, but published a year prior, <strong>Leo Kanner</strong> became a public figure with <em>Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact</em>.  In doing so, they stirred up <strong>decades of confusion</strong> about the ways in which autism manifests</strong> (<strong>hint</strong>: they were only interested in writing about young white male specimens). (Silberman, 2014, pp. 82-186)

<strong>Ole Ivar Løvaas</strong>, already featured on the cover of Time magazine for his work literally <strong>beating the divergence out of children</strong>, lorded over both the Young Autism Project (designed to make them <strong>indistinguishable</strong> from peers) and the Feminine Boy Project (the largest federally funded project of its kind, designed to intervene similarly in the lives of <strong>sissy boys</strong>). (Yergeau, 2018, pp. 89-134)

"Kayleb Moon-Robinson, an autistic and black child who, at the <strong>age of eleven</strong>, was charged with disorderly conduct for <strong>kicking a trash can</strong> at school.  ... arrested for felonious assault when he resisted going to the principal’s office after the school resource officer attempted to forcibly drag him there.  ...  This 6th grade child has to face <strong>life as a convicted felon</strong> before he’s even old enough to drive." (Yergeau, 2018, p. 157)

The relevant, and disappointing, makeup of Autism Speaks leadership in the year 2013: "Of the thirty-three board members, twenty-five were white men and <strong>only one</strong> board member was a <strong>person of color</strong>.  All board members, of course, were <strong>nonautistic</strong>." (Yergeau, 2018, p. 158)
					<p class="apa fragment">
Research priorities are not established by autistic people (many of whom are parents), who have been freely offering help to (warrior) parents of autistic children only to be unironically rejected as not autistic enough to have a voice in the conversation.  For those tracking the math, <strong>less than 4%</strong> of all autism related research spending was devoted to subjects addressing concerns actually supported by the <strong>autistic adult community</strong>. (Bascom et al, 2012, p. 272)

U.S. Department of Defense seemed dubious of their own study results showing year over year data with <strong>76%</strong> of ABA cases resulting in <strong>no change</strong>, an additional <strong>9%</strong> with <strong>worse</strong> results, yet no hint of describing the modality in a negative light. (Stewart, 2019, p. 10)

A recent call out for therapists, educators, and other professionals in <em>Guiding Principles for a Course on Autism</em>: "The present state of <strong>autism related discourse</strong>, theory, and praxis in the academic and professional spheres is <strong>deplorable</strong>.  The discourse and theory reflect a level of <strong>ignorance and bigotry</strong> that would be regarded as <strong>scandalous</strong> in most academic circles today if it involved <strong>any other historically oppressed group</strong>."

"Unfortunately, it's exactly the powerful momentum of how things are done which keeps people from thinking much about the things they are doing.  ...  Every person in power who <strong>unthinkingly chooses or supports indistinguishability</strong> is adding to its mass.  It's an army of laziness, an army (usually) of feeling safe in your body.  Of being able to talk about how much you love <em>The Office</em> in between sessions of training [an autistic kid] <strong>not to make jokes that don't have an obvious punchline</strong>." (Bascom et al, 2012, p. 282)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
"The shift from the pathology paradigm to the <strong>neurodiversity paradigm</strong> calls for a radical shift in language.  ... we <strong>speak of autistics</strong> in the same way we would speak of <strong>any other social minority group</strong>....  In the long run, the sort of language that’s used to talk about autistics has enormous influence on how society treats us, and on the messages we internalize about ourselves." (Walker, 2021, p. 21-22)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
"There's a growing body of published work, including both personal accounts and scholarly research, on how the <strong>suppression</strong> of non-normative embodiments for the sake of <strong>compliance</strong> with standards of neuronormative performance ... does <strong>profound psychological harm</strong> to neurodivergent people and is strongly correlated with depression and suicidality." (Walker, 2021, p. 186)

Communication comes in many forms, most of which are ignored in <strong>ableist public discourse</strong>.  One's lack of effective use of mouth words has nothing to do with whether or not they have anything to say.  Situational Mutism is a thing (<em>and any reader currently discovering this is encouraged to behave as an ally in looking it up before coming back to the topic with trauma informed questions of those with lived experience</em>).  Expressions in <strong>autistethnographies</strong> come richly varied, detailed, and are often <strong>freely available</strong>. (Yergeau, 2018, pp. 24-28)

Divergent Presentation: Conclusion
					</div>
					<p class="apa fragment">
Moving beyond the <strong>violence of normal</strong> is a minimum first step toward the <strong>liberation</strong> of neurodivergent bodyminds.  Radical acceptance of atypical presence and discarding old tooling are required next steps, or we’ll continue building the same destructive experiences.  We must stop recognizing normal as a valid human diversity concept. (Walker, 2021, pp. 16-28)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
"The pathology paradigm is nothing more than <strong>institutionalized bigotry</strong> masquerading as science.  ...  When we hear someone refer to autism as a 'disorder' or 'condition,' it should instantly set off the <strong>same sort of alarm bells</strong> in our minds as hearing someone refer to homosexuality as a 'disorder' or refer to a member of some specific ethnic group as 'inferior'." (Walker, 2021, pp. 129-131)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
To honestly address discomfort surrounding neurodivergence we need to focus on the <strong>perils of passing</strong>, "which include overwhelming stress, self-hatred, and loss of autistic identity and community.  ...  Judy Endow argues that nondisabled people <strong>wrongly assume</strong> theirs to be the <strong>natural sociality</strong>, effectively <strong>othering</strong> and quashing disabled means of communicating and knowing.  ...  Rachel Cohen-Rottenburg asserts that passing is an imitation borne of compliance, wherein "<strong>burnout [is] inevitable</strong>." (Yergeau, 2018, p. 194)
					</p>
					<p class="apa fragment">
Ari Ne'eman had this to say while celebrating the 5th anniversary of creating the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, "Even love, in the <strong>absence of empathy</strong>, can be harmful.  When people that you talk about, or set policy on, or conduct research regarding, are not in the same room, even good people feel licensed to say horrible things.  You cannot help people through pity and fear." (Bascom et al, 2012, p. 100)
