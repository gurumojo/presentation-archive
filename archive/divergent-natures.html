I have been told I'm angry, without feeling any anger within myself, more times
than I can count.  I have been told I'm aggressive while sitting motionless and
calm in a refusal to comply with unreasonable demands.  The assumed inferences
behind sentences I so carefully craft for precise semantic value are taken in
gross misinterpretations of the literal definitions of included words time and
time again....

<em>The radical, committed to human liberation, does not become the prisoner of a “circle of
certainty” within which reality is also imprisoned. On the contrary, the more radical the
person is, the more fully [they enter] into reality so that, knowing it better, [they] can
better transform it. This individual is not afraid to confront, to listen, to see the world
unveiled. This person is not afraid to meet the people or to enter into dialogue with them.
This person does not consider [themself] the proprietor of history or of all people, or the
liberator of the oppressed; but [they do] commit [themself], within history, to fight at their
side.</em>

The rushing through life demanded by the <em>Empire of Normality</em> (Chapman, 2023),
this race to nowhere which inspires bloody wars and destruction of entire
ecosystems in the service of creating novel distractions for bored oligarchs, is
perfectly countered by womanist wisdom in the <em>Nap Ministry</em> (Hersey, 2022),
<em>Radical Self-Love</em> (Taylor, 2020), and the commitment to lean into
processing clean pain in order to avoid passing along any more dirty pain
from traumatic retentions and immature fragility (Menakem, 2017).

While ecopsychology studies the relationship between humans and nature (Roszak

Nature is included as a partner in therapy, offering a
wide variety of tools, interventions, and contexts.

Without extending trust and compassionate actions in support of people reporting

Even with the best of intentions, when autistic people are not in the room, allistics
continue to say horrible and dehumanizing things.  This follows from frequently
encountered marketing and (anti-)advocacy messages and reinforces the harmful
praxis that results from failing to include the voices of those most directly and
adversely effected by dehumanization and ignorant demands for compliance to
some mythological story about easily managed homogeneity and what it means to be normal.

<em>In order to provide space for autistic people to live authentically, we need to
consider what can be done beyond the responsibility of the individual. As we
have acknowledged, autistic people (and marginalised people more broadly) have
limited power to shape the narrative, and thus to lead to social and cultural
changes needed to safely foster authenticity.</em>
