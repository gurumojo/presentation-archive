PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING & PERSONAL CONNECTEDNESS TO NATURE - Wolsko & Lindberg (2013)

<ul>
<li>Assessed relationship between the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS), psychological well-being, mindfulness, and outdoor recreation</li>
<li>CNS assess emotional connection to nature and “experiential sense of oneness with the natural world” (Mayer & Frantz, 2004, p. 504)</li>
<li>Higher CNS scores were associated with higher scores on both hedonic (what is pleasurable, i.e. positive emotions) and eudaimonic (what is meaningful, i.e. experiencing living a fulfilling life) aspects of well-being</li>
<li>Individuals who reported experiencing more connection with nature reported higher levels of fulfillment in significant life areas (i.e., interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, ect.) subjective vitality, and positive emotions</li>
<li>The study indicates that individuals who experience stronger feelings of connection with nature are likely to have greater psychological well-being</li>

CRITICAL REVIEW: STPE, MEANINGFUL PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES & PERSONAL CONNECTEDNESS TO NATURE - Newton & Moreton (2022)
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Mystical experiences, ego-dissolution (ED), and self-transcendent positive emotions (STPE) during meaningful psychedelic experiences were positively correlated with increased feelings of connection to nature as measured by CNS and Inclusion of Nature in Self scale (INS) scores.</li>
<li>Findings suggest that feelings of gratitude, compassion, and awe (STPE) during psychedelic experiences, specifically, can have a bottom-down effect, and are not only positively correlated with connectedness to nature, but also affect an individual's disposition to experience STPE outside of the psychedelic experience in the future.</li>

SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS OF PSYCHEDELICS & NATURE FOR MENTAL HEALTH - Gandy et al. (2020)
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Psychedelics have the potential to increase nature relatedness or connectedness, which is associated with psychological health and well-being</li>
<li>Contact with nature and measures of nature connectedness are associated with many psychological benefits and are strong predictors of psychological well-being</li>
<li>Both psychedelics and contact with nature: 
<ul>
<li>reduce rumination and activity in brain regions involved in depression</li>
<li>have the capacity to increase a sense of connectedness</li>
<li>increase the quality trait of openness </li>
<li>foster mindful capacities </li>
<li>reduce negative affect</li>
<li>elicit awe</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Psychedelic use with the intent to connect with nature have been associated with greater well-being scores in comparison to other motivations behind use
</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
All these are linked to enhanced psychological well-being. Separately, both psychedelics and nature contact can act as amplifiers for the therapeutic process, so together they have synergetic benefits. *Eudaimonic well-being is defined by authors as: subjective experiences linked to living a life of virtue in pursuit of human excellence, associated with experiences of self-actualisation, vitality and personal expressiveness. *ED is “‘a disruption of ego-boundaries, which results in a blurring of the distinction between self-representation and object-representation’ (Nour et al., 2016) and is strongly associated with nature relatedness.”

We decided what we were going to measure. We decided to measure past experiences. Collecting the data via a survey was a useful tool. We did a sampling rather than a continuous observation. The survey administered could be beneficial to take after each psychedelic experience in a nature-based setting.
