						Client Testimony
					</h2>
					<p>
						This feedback was offered by a client who had spent 6
						months engaged in weekly therapy sessions.  Out of state
						relocation required us to terminate service.
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						LÃ­f was one of the best counselors I could have asked for.
						Their lived experiences in a variety of marginalized
						communities made it a lot easier for me to feel safe and
						understood. They respected the fact that I had a very
						rigid comfort zone but also wasn't afraid to help the work
						get done when I was ready for it. I'm truly grateful for
						the experience I had with them and Divergence.
