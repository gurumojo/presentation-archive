Consideration of Underexplored Autistic Potentials

				<aside class="notes">
“Autism is rarely conceived as a causal of talent, unless that talent can be
economically capitalized” (Yergeau & Huebner, 2017, p. 281). Perhaps this
dissertation will help to inspire future research into the prevalence of such
underexplored autistic potentials and how they might be more consistently
recognized and cultivated (Walker, 2019, p. 161).
<br /><br />
My hope is that in highlighting here how my students and my dojo
community derive unique and significant benefits from my autistic style of
perception and cognition, I can help to inspire those who embark upon further
inquiry into the topic of autistic participation in communities of practice to
remember to look not only at how autistic participants in such communities
benefit, but also at how they contribute (Walker, 2019, p. 173).
<br /><br />
The exploitation of autistic labor and autistic talent is an entire separate
dissertation topic in itself, which I hope someone else will write someday but
which falls outside the scope of this present inquiry (Walker, 2019, p. 260-261).

Autism has traditionally been portrayed as a state of disconnection, and
autistics stereotyped as cut off from the world, incapable of connection, impaired
in the realm of interactivity (Biklen, 2005; Gernsbacher & Frymiare, 2005;
McGuire, 2016; Silberman, 2015; Smukler, 2005; Yergeau, 2013, 2018). But
what I see in my own experiences and in the accounts of various other autistic
authors (e.g., Baggs, 2007; Mukhopadhyay, 2003, 2008, 2015; Prahlad, 2017;
Prince-Hughes, 2004, 2013; Savarese, 2014, 2018; D. Williams, 1999) is not so
much a pathological state of disconnection or lack of interactive capacity, as an
innate proclivity for connection and attunement to certain aspects of the vertical
that supersedes and is incompatible with attunement to neurotypical norms of
horizontal sociality (Walker, 2019, p. 208).
<br /><br />
Consider Manning’s (2013) characterization of
autistic consciousness—accurate, in my experience—as tending toward liminal
states in which the informational field is not automatically parsed or “pre-chunked” (p. 219)
into a fixed world of discrete subjects, objects, concepts, and
certainties, but is instead experienced as a “field of resonance” (p. 177), alive with
potential and “morphability” (p. 219). (Walker, 2019, p. 212-213).
<br /><br />
Bogdashina notes that “In autism the experience of ‘true/pure self’ is often
spontaneous, or easily achieved (if voluntary)” (p. 144) (Walker, 2019, p. 212).
<br /><br />
No-form “acts as a bridge to the internal landscape of archetypal material”
(Alli, 2003, p. 107). The receptivity of no-form allows one to attune to a source
and be responsive to it on a deep bodily level, so that the source and one’s
relationship to it can be given spontaneous expression through the medium of
one’s embodiment, physical movements, and voice (Walker, 2019, p. 210).

The armor that defends also restricts and imprisons (Walker, 2019, p. 215).
<br /><br />
[The] de-armoring process initially tends to
bring to the surface all the feelings that were bound into or locked up behind
whatever layers of armor are being released (Büntig, 2015; Grand, 1998; E. W. L.
Smith, 1985). So my chronic depression was supplanted, at first, not by a
consistently better emotional state, but by an increase in anger and emotional
volatility (Walker, 2019, p. 231).
<br /><br />
In my own experience, stimming and other distinctive manifestations of
autistic embodiment have proven to be inextricably entwined not only with
exceptional autistic abilities, but also with basic autistic psychological resilience
and wellbeing, autistic cognitive functioning, and autistic capacities for creativity,
happiness, healthy interpersonal connection, and self-actualization (Walker, 2019, p. 229).
<br /><br />
The more I opened myself to vertical energies, the more those energies
moved through me in ways that broke down character armor. And the more
character armor I shed in those cathartic releases, the more deeply and thoroughly
I could drop into no-form … thus enabling me to become an even more open
conduit for vertical energies, which resulted in further cathartic release of armor,
which enabled even deeper access to no-form, and so on (Walker, 2019, p. 225).
<br /><br />
My bodymind had less use for the sort of dramatically pronounced stims
stereotypically associated with autistic bodily movement (e.g., rapid hand-flapping),
because the various needs that stimming meets for autistics—
processing, integration, regulation, release, access to cognitive capacities, sensory
engagement and exploration, pleasure, vertical communion, and so on—were
being constantly satisfied through the fluid, subtle, continuous stimming that had
become an integral part of my ever-shifting, moment-to-moment, organismic
dance of self-shaping (Walker, 2019, p. 237).

I remember that other kids have mocked and
sometimes assaulted me for the way I move my hands. It occurs to me that if
these boys spot my hands moving it will draw their attention. I quickly jam my
hands into my pockets and walk on, pretending to be going somewhere. The boys
ignore me. It worked! Next time I walk around the playground, I keep my hands
in my pockets. It makes me a little bit safer, and I barely notice that I feel a little
bit less alive (Walker, 2018). (Walker, 2019, p. 217).
<br /><br />
The largest study on the topic found that
long-term habitual “camouflaging” (Cassidy et al., 2018, p. 11) of outwardly
visible expressions of autism “significantly predicted suicidality in [adult
autistics], after controlling for age, sex, … employment, and satisfaction with
living arrangements” (p. 11), and that “camouflaging is directly associated with
suicidality” (p. 11) (Walker, 2019, p. 219-220).
<br /><br />
[It] was one of those things, like neurotypical social cues and so many other
baffling processes in the neurotypical world, that everyone else just seemed to
magically know about and seemed to expect me to also magically know (Walker, 2019, p. 175).
<br /><br />
I didn’t blame myself for the difficult circumstances of my life or for the
fact that I’d been able to achieve so little of what I wanted. These were
consequences of economic injustice, systemic ableism, and the dynamics of a
warped and brutal society that denied most nonaffluent people and autistic people
the opportunity to live lives worthy of their potentials (Walker, 2019, p. 187).
<br /><br />
In arguing that a focus on self-actualization through transformative
practice can serve to foster autistic wellbeing where the praxis of the pathology
paradigm has consistently failed to do so, this dissertation takes a position in
alignment with the neurodiversity paradigm, with humanistic priorities, and with
Winnicott’s (1971/2005) position “that living creatively is a healthy state, and that
compliance is a sick basis for life” (p. 88) (Walker, 2019, p. 254-255).
					</div>

Self-actualization,
as conceptualized in humanistic psychology, involves the discovery, embrace, and
authentic expression of the unique individual creative potentials of the “real self”
(Rowan & Glouberman, 2018)—or what Winnicott (1965), not technically a
humanistic psychologist but certainly among the more humanistically inclined of
the major psychodynamic thinkers, referred to as the True Self . Humanistic
psychology in general—and the goal of self-actualization in particular—is thus
fundamentally at odds with the agenda of compulsory normativity, conformity,
and compliance that characterizes the pathology paradigm (Walker, 2019, p. 254).
<br /><br />
[The] wellbeing of autistics might be better served not simply by aiming toward
goals of long-term psychospiritual development and self-actualization, but by
actively choosing to prioritize those goals over the imposition of neurotypical
standards of normativity.  It’s worth reiterating here that the imposition of
normativity can be outright harmful, and that at least in my case it proved to be in
direct conflict with the path of wellbeing and self-actualization (Walker, 2019, p. 271).
<br /><br />
I reject the fundamental premise behind the systems of praxis
generated by the pathology paradigm, the premise that autism is “improvable”—
in other words, that an autistic person can be or would be “improved” by being
somehow brought into closer compliance with neurotypical norms.  What I do
believe, however, is that the human psychospiritual condition is improvable, by
means of dedicated participation in transformative practice (Walker, 2019, p. 253).
<br /><br />
The task of radically reshaping of discourses and systems of praxis toward
the aim of actually serving the wellbeing of autistic people will require the
foregrounding of autistic voices and autistic experience. This necessity becomes
immediately obvious once one steps away from the distorting lens of the
pathology paradigm and considers the matter in terms of the dynamics of human
diversity and social power: how well have the members of any minority group
ever fared when their own voices and perspectives haven’t had primacy in
shaping the dominant discourses and systems of praxis pertaining to their lives... (Walker, 2019, p. 255)?
					</div>
				</section>

Disciplinary discourses on autism, and the theories and praxis they
produce—regardless of their many superficial differences—have continued to
unfold within, and to be shaped by, the framework of the pathology paradigm and
its fundamental assumptions (Walker, 2016; Yergeau, 2018). Within these
discourses, for instance, various differences arise regarding the nature, etiology,
or proper treatment of “Autism Spectrum Disorder,” but never over the
legitimacy, purposes, or impacts of presuming autism to be a disorder or
medicalized “condition” in the first place, or the potential implications,
possibilities, and benefits of not presuming it to be a disorder (Walker, 2019, p. 246).
<br /><br />
To thrive as I have, such discourses
would lead one to believe, an autistic person would first somehow have to cease
being autistic. And yet it was only through fully embracing and embodying my
autistic nature that I was able to truly begin to access my higher potentials for
psychospiritual wellbeing... (Walker, 2019, p. 244).
<br /><br />
When one takes a step back from the pathology paradigm and starts to question its
underlying assumptions, those assumptions reveal themselves to be of dubious
validity, to say the least—absurd relics of the sort of thinking that dominated the
field of psychology back when the discourse on autism began in the early 1940s,
embarrassingly archaic and hidebound when held up to the light of more
progressive modern understandings of human diversity (Walker, 2019, p. 247).
<br /><br />
I would argue that it’s the pathology
paradigm that’s extreme, inasmuch as any ideology that views one specific group
of humans as naturally superior and seeks to eliminate divergences from the
norms of that group is inherently an extremist ideology, no matter how widely it
comes to be accepted and normalized within a given society in a given era (Walker, 2019, p. 247).
<br /><br />
The emergent neurodiversity paradigm represents a very real and viable
alternative to the pathology paradigm’s long, shameful, and still-ongoing history
of oppressive discourse, bigotry masquerading as theory, and fundamentally
unsound and abusive praxis (Walker, 2019, p. 249).

The foregrounding of autistic experience means not only
giving primacy to autistic voices, autistic perspectives, autistic narratives, and
autistic ways of knowing, but also giving primacy to autistic wellbeing as a focus
of praxis, and recognizing autistic wellbeing as an agenda distinct from—and not
always necessarily in alignment with—neurotypical agendas for autistics (Walker, 2019, p. 261).
<br /><br />
Non-autistic authors writing about autistic experience ...  have the luxury of
simply remaining oblivious to any aspects or nuances of autistic experience that
fall outside the scope of what they can readily articulate or imagine. It’s far easier
and far more common for non-autistics to write inaccurately about autistic
experience than to write accurately about it—and when first-hand autistic
narratives are absent, ignored, or discounted, it’s easy to get away with writing
inaccurately about autistic experience and even to build a career on doing so (Walker, 2019, p. 256-257).
<br /><br />
The inclusion of autistic voices and autistic narratives in the discourses on
autistic lives and autistic wellbeing is essential, but not sufficient. When I speak
of foregrounding autistic experience, I mean not only looking to first-hand autistic
narratives of lived experience as the most valid and indispensable source of
knowledge on autistic lives, but also looking to those narratives as a primary
standard for assessing the validity of other sources of knowledge on the topic (Walker, 2019, p. 257).
<br /><br />
In the academic and professional discourses and realms of praxis that
focus specifically on attempting to address the needs and wellbeing of the autistic
population, however, the idea of autistics actively working toward goals of
transpersonal experience, psychospiritual growth, and self-actualization is
conspicuously absent (Walker, 2019, p. 269).
<br /><br />
I didn’t truly begin to thrive until I’d made substantial progress in
using transformative practices to undo my internalized normativity on
a deep bodily level (Walker, 2019, p. 270).
					</div>

				<section>

[An] ever-growing body of first-hand accounts by autistics regarding their
own lived experiences points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the various
systems of normativity-oriented praxis generated by the pathology paradigm are
consistently failing to support long-term autistic wellbeing and are in fact actively
harmful and trauma-inducing (e.g., Asasumasu, 2012, 2013a; Bascom, 2012; S. R.
Jones, 2013, 2016; Monje, 2016a). Autistic people, again, can only truly thrive as
autistic people, not as imitations of non-autistic people; one does not attain long-term
wellbeing by stifling one’s True Self (Walker, 2019, p. 283).
<br /><br />
The pathology paradigm’s dubious conflation of compliant normativity
with wellbeing stands in marked contrast with perspectives on human wellbeing
found in the fields of humanistic psychology, positive psychology, and
transpersonal psychology. In these fields, optimal wellbeing is generally
conceptualized not as compliance and conformity but as transcendence of rote
normativity in the pursuit of psychospiritual growth, self-actualization, and
realization of higher human potentials for authenticity, creativity, joy, wisdom,
inner peace and stability, connection, intimacy, spontaneity, harmony, and peak
experience (Walker, 2019, p. 283).
<br /><br />
[The] systems of transformative somatic practice that have
traditionally been recognized as pathways to the realization of higher
psychospiritual potentials in non-autistic practitioners can serve that same
function in the lives of autistic practitioners (Walker, 2019, p. 280).
<br /><br />
... autistic asociality can often be an asset in the context of transformative practice (Walker, 2019, p. 274).
<br /><br />
In terms of praxis, then, I’d venture to suggest that two crucial
implications of my narrative are that true inclusion will involve autistic
participants in transformative practices (or in any other realm of human activity)
not only in the roles of students and beneficiaries, but also as teachers and leaders;
and that praxis aimed at cultivating positive autistic potentials should not neglect
autistic potentials for leadership (Walker, 2019, p. 278).

Because the idea that stimming ought to be suppressed in the interest
of normativity is so deeply ingrained in the mindset of so many of the
professionals who work with young autistics, I think this lesson bears repeating
again here: stimming is essential to autistic wellbeing and should not be
discouraged or suppressed (Walker, 2019, p. 276).
<br /><br />
[Somatic] psychology concepts—like the release of character armor and
Winnicott’s (1965) conceptions of the True Self and False Self—were relevant to
praxis aimed at autistic wellbeing and autistic self-actualization (Walker, 2019, p. 282).
<br /><br />
The process of de-armoring has been an essential part of my path toward psychospiritual wellbeing
and self-actualization, and is something I recommend as part of the cultivation of
autistic wellbeing (and human wellbeing in general). In making such a
recommendation, I also recommend taking into consideration the likelihood that
some amount of autistic character armor originates as an instinctive defense
against sensory overwhelm (Walker, 2019, p. 275-276).
<br /><br />
[A] two-stage formula, in which techniques for centering and grounding are
learned before de-armoring commences, is also recommended by some somatic
psychotherapists as an approach to working with trauma (Ogden et al., 2006) (Walker, 2019, p. 276).
<br /><br />
[To] improve a neurodivergent person’s wellbeing would mean to
improve it by that person’s own personal subjective standards rather than by
neurotypical standards of what a person’s life ought to look like from the outside (Walker, 2019, p. 259).

Those who have an interest in the question of how to help autistics learn to
better navigate the neurotypical social world might do well to consider the fact
that despite having had every bit as much social difficulty in childhood as any
other autistic I know of, I currently navigate that world with a degree of skill,
ease, pleasure, and success that is fairly rare among autistics—and that this is, as
far as I can tell, entirely a result of the long-term engagement in transformative
practices recounted in the preceding chapters. Although these practices had an
asocial orientation, they enabled me to develop and bring into embodiment a
combination of confidence, ease, relaxed expansiveness, comfort with myself, and
mindful attunement to others, and this combination of embodied qualities has
formed the basis for—and readily translated into—a comfortable and versatile
sociality far more natural and far more grounded in my authentic self than
anything that would likely have resulted if I’d been subjected to one of those
programs of “social skills” training designed for autistics by neurotypicals (Walker, 2019, p. 274-275).
<br /><br />
... certain qualities of autistic perception and
cognition shaped my experience of aikido training and ultimately proved to be
assets to me as a practitioner and teacher (e.g., instinctive attunement to the
asocial over the social that made it easy for me to look beyond social cues to the
deeper dynamics of interacting bodies, exceptional tactile and kinesthetic
sensitivity, and affinity for what I’ve termed the aesthetics of emergence) (Walker, 2019, p. 281).
<br /><br />
What was missing from my aikido, of course, was the same thing that had
been missing from every other aspect of my life for so long: me, the dance of my
autistic True Self. Aikido, after all, is ultimately about not only harmony but
connection (Holiday, 2013; Leonard, 1999)—simultaneous connection with
others, with one’s own felt embodiment, and with the vertical sources that O-Sensei
spoke of as the ki of the universe or the kami (Holiday, 2013; Saotome,
1993). And, as Winnicott (1965) observed, it’s only the True Self that can make
and sustain connections of real integrity and depth (Walker, 2019, p. 239).
<br /><br />
What I needed to do in order to bring my
aikido to the levels I’d been seeking, to begin to truly realize my potentials as an
aikidoka, was the same thing that I needed to do to improve the rest of my life:
practice becoming so responsive to the promptings of my autistic True Self that
my embodiment became a continuous, fluid, self-shaping dance of stimming (Walker, 2019, p. 240).
