The innate human tendency for biophilia (the effortless adoration of and enduring connection to natural objects, beings, elements, and processes) demands a sea-change from a too-common perspective of natural separation, categorization, and domination.  Our human-nature connections form the basis of sustainable and scalable ecologies of practice (Flaherty, Heider, & Larson, 2023).

When one's very identity is commonly held as an object of disgust, there is remarkably little choice left to those seeking to show up in community with an authentic presence beyond the counter-social behavior of demanding change (Yergeau, 2018).  What choice may remain is built upon assimilation, not options for freedom of expression, much less the agency in choice beyond false binaries.

A transitional politics that centres the surplus and, crucially, finds ways to empower the surplus <span style="font-style:normal">as surplus</span>, will need to take different forms to traditional union organising, which is based on the threat of withholding regular waged labour. <span style="font-style:normal">[...]</span> It may be that demand for Universal Basic Income gives those members of surplus who have never worked more economic power -- primarily the power to withhold as consumers but also to organise towards direct action -- regardless of whether they can withhold labour.
