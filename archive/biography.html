					<h2>
						Professional Biography
					</h2>
					<p>
						As a clinician trained in transpersonal wilderness therapy,
						I stand ready to provide ecotherapy, horticulture, and other
						nature-based options for healing and personal growth sourced
						from many different wisdom traditions. Using tools like rites
						of passage and ritual, among others more common to trauma
						informed and social justice focus areas, we may work together on
						anything you are ready to bring into a therapeutic relationship.
					</p>
					<p>
						Are you ready to make an investment in your own future wellness?
						Are you looking for a clinician with a profound capacity for
						sitting with difference or discomfort? Look no further.
					</p>
					<p>
						Coming of age while focused on vocal music training provided me
						with an embodied sense that humans share much more than spoken
						languages every day. Recently retired from a technology career,
						I seek to answer resounding calls from neurodivergent and queer
						populations for support from counselors with similar lived
						experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						I frequently express an ability to offer novel insight based on
						skillful observation, intersectional awareness, and presence in
						attunement while helping people make meaning from within various
						social locations, intentions, and experiences.
