					<h2>
						Claim Your Most True Self
					</h2>
					<p>
						Back in the summer of 2009, I began an intentional journey
						of personal discovery and healing in earnest.  Throughout
						my life I had struggled in most of the places I was granted
						any level of access.
					</p>
					<p>
						I registered a domain name, thinking it would remain in
						obscurity.  Perhaps it would host back-end services for
						others in need of technical solutions....  Perhaps it would
						attract contributors looking to share thier own unique
						expression of <span class="em">gurumojo</span> with the world....
						Perhaps it would coalesce into a brand at some point....  At
						that time I didn't have any idea how it might manifest.  I
						trusted in moving with purpose toward destinations unfamiliar.
					</p>
					<p>
						The root words in this invented name combine original
						meanings in a wholly novel way.  From <span class="em">guru</span>,
						it invokes the Sanskrit term for a teacher, a guide, one
						"worthy of respect."  This acknowledgement of ancient wisdom
						pairs with <span class="em">mojo</span>, a word used in modern
						parlance to evoke ideas of magic or control, a
						"seemingly supernatural power, influence, or ability."
					</p>
					<p>
						How do you relate to the idea of wielding
						<span class="em">gurumojo</span>?
