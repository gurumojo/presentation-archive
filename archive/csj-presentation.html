Guideline 1:  Psychologists seek to recognize and understand that identity and self-definition are fluid and complex and that the interaction between the two is dynamic.  To this end, psychologists appreciate that intersectionality is shaped by the multiplicity of the individual's social contexts.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 2:  Psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that asx cultural beings, they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions of and interactions with others as well as their clinical and empirical conceptualizations.  As such, psychologists strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 3:  Psychologists strive to recognize and understand the role of language and communication through engagement that is sensitive to the lived experience of the individual, couple, family, group, community, and/or organizations with whom they interact.  Psychologists also seek to understand how they bring their own language and communication to these ingteractions.

					<br /><br />

Guideline 8:  Psychoplogists seek awareness and understanding of how developmental stages and life transitions intersect with the larger biosociocultural context, how identity evolves as a function of such intersections, and how these different socialization and maturation experiences influence worldview and identity.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 9:  Psychologists strive to conduct culturally appropriate and informed research, teaching, supervision, consultation, assessment, interpretation, diagnosis, dissemination, and evaluation of efficacy as they address the first four levels of the <em>Layered Ecological Model of the Multicultural Guidelines</em>.

Clinical Social Justice: Implications in Practice

The American Counseling Association has endorsed competencies developed by <a href="https://www.counseling-csj.org/">Counselors for Social Justice</a>.
					</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment">
Knowing that individuals' experiences and behaviors can only be understood accurately in context, we have the professional responsibility [to avoid ignoring] clients' social and cultural contexts when working with them.
					</blockquote>
					<p class="apa fragment">
The "Social Conscience of ACA" curates educational content, organizes networking conferences, and provides therapists with <a href="https://www.counseling-csj.org/take-action-now.html">clear calls to action</a>.
					</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment">
As seen at the page linked above, CSJ provides templates including items for prior consideration, talking point script examples, and clear messaging about the opptions suggested for responding to a call to action:<br /><br />CALL, CONNECT, COLLABORATE, COMMUNICATE, and CONTRIBUTE.
					</blockquote>
					<p class="apa fragment">
Ultimately, harm-free relationships are best approached through embracing an identity focused on social justice, and working within the communities we serve to build more inclusive spaces.
					</p>
