Counselors for Social Justice is a national division of the American Counseling Association.
CSJ works to promote social justice in our society through confronting oppressive systems of
power and privilege that affect professional counselors and our clients and to assist in the
positive change in our society through the professional development of counselors.

1) INCREASE AWARENESS and knowledge of social justice concerns
2) ENHANCE ABILITY of counselors to engage in social justice action and advocacy
3) BUILD A COMMUNITY of counselors committed to social justice nationally and internationally

Includes two pictures:

 * A Black woman in a crowded street, wearing a Counselor's for Social Justice T-shirt,
   holding a hand-made sign which reads: Protect KIDS _not_ guns!  #ENOUGH
 * 11 people of mixed R.E.C. backgrounds in professional dress, with 3 seated, in a lobby space

Guideline 1:  Psychologists seek to recognize and understand that identity and self-definition are fluid and complex and that the interaction between the two is dynamic.  To this end, psychologists appreciate that intersectionality is shaped by the multiplicity of the individual's social contexts.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 2:  Psychologists aspire to recognize and understand that as cultural beings, they hold attitudes and beliefs that can influence their perceptions of and interactions with others as well as their clinical and empirical conceptualizations.  As such, psychologists strive to move beyond conceptualizations rooted in categorical assumptions, biases, and/or formulations based on limited knowledge about individuals and communities.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 3:  Psychologists strive to recognize and understand the role of language and communication through engagement that is sensitive to the lived experience of the individual, couple, family, group, community, and/or organizations with whom they interact.  Psychologists also seek to understand how they bring their own language and communication to these interactions.

Guideline 4:  Psychologists endeavor to be aware of the role of the social and physical environment in the lives of clients, students, research participants, and/or consultees.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 5:  Psychologists aspire to recognize and understand historical and contemporary experiences with power, privilege, and oppression.  As such, they seek to address insitutional barriers and related inequities, disproportionalities, and disparities of law enforcement, administration of criminal justice, educational, mental health, and other systems as they seek to promote justice, human rights, and access to quality and equitable mental and behavioral health services.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 6:  Psychologists seek to promote culturally adaptive interventions and advocacy within and across systems, including prevention, early intervention, and recovery.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 7:  Psychologists endeavor to examine the profession's assumptions and practices within an international context, whether domestically or internationally based, and consider how this globalization has an impact on the psychologist's self-definition, purpose, role, and function.

Guideline 8:  Psychologists seek awareness and understanding of how developmental stages and life transitions intersect with the larger biosociocultural context, how identity evolves as a function of such intersections, and how these different socialization and maturation experiences influence worldview and identity.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 9:  Psychologists strive to conduct culturally appropriate and informed research, teaching, supervision, consultation, assessment, interpretation, diagnosis, dissemination, and evaluation of efficacy as they address the first four levels of the <em>Layered Ecological Model of the Multicultural Guidelines</em>.
					<br /><br />
Guideline 10:  Psychologists actively strive to take a strength-based approach when working with individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations that seeks to build resilience and decrease trauma within the sociocultural context.
